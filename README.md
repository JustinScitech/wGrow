###wGrow is a small device that checks and monitors if the environment is suitable for greenery and plant growth through light, heat, moisture, and pH trackers/sensors. It also provides raw data in forms of graphs and tables to show the long term environmental changes in these areas. 

## How it works

The wGrow device is comprised of a circuit with breadboard and wires connected to an STM32 MCU. The data is interpreted and analyzed in the **STM32Cube IDE** using the **STM32 library** based on the inputs from the sensors. Through this connection, the tracked data from the components will then be able to be sent off to the app storing the data.
