# ðŸŒ¿ wGrow - Interactive Plant Monitoring Device

Are you tired of manually monitoring the health of your plants? Introducing wGrow - the interactive plant monitoring device that makes it easy to ensure your plants are getting the care they need to thrive through visualizing graphical data for plant growth.

wGrow is a small device that checks and monitors the environment to ensure it is suitable for plant growth. It does this by utilizing light, heat, moisture, and pH sensors to track key environmental factors that are crucial to plant growth. The device provides detailed graphical data that can be easily interpreted, allowing users to make informed decisions about how to best care for their plants.

## How it works
- The wGrow device is built using a circuit with a breadboard and wires connected to an STM32 MCU. 
- The data is interpreted and analyzed in the STM32Cube IDE using the STM32 library based on the inputs from the sensors. 
- The tracked data from the components is then sent off to the app through a bluetooth sensor, where it is stored for further analysis and visualization. The app is currently still in development although the wireframing and UI designs were completed in Figma

With wGrow, you'll be able to view raw data in the form of graphs and tables, showing long-term environmental changes in the areas that affect plant growth.

Here my partner and I designed schematics and PCB layout diagrams using KiCad and created documentation and instructions for physical assembly, allowing the project to be replicated by manufacturing plants and users.

Check out this repository for more information and to see the code and schematics for the project. With wGrow, taking care of your plants has never been easier!
